The Debian Package art-of-reading
---------------------------------
These images (plus the index.txt and License.txt files) were retrieved from
the Windows installer ArtOfReading3FreeSetup.exe downloaded from
http://downloads.palaso.org/ArtOfReading/.  I added the Makefile and the
debian packaging.  Some reference was made to an earlier package setup done
by Daniel Glassey, but he bears no responsibility for the content or format
of this package.
